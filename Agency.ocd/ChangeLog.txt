Legend:
Uses semantic/behavioural versioning: major version, minor version, patch.
- The patch number is incremented for minor changes and bug fixes which do not change the interface/behaviour.
- The minor version is incremented for new, but backward-compatible features.
- The major version is incremented for changes which are not backward-compatible.
- Version numbers are increased when a release adds one or multiple of the aforementioned changes, per category.
- Version numbers minor and patch are reset when the major version increases.
